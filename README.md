# Translator
This repository contains the code and the compiled files of the Translator project

If you want to install this app, you have the choice between a portable and a setup version. The two are running correctly but if you're
installing the setup version, please copy the folders "Latin" and "French" to the installation directory, then you will be able to run the
app.

Please note this app is actually not finished and can only translate from Latin to French.
